1. i am not a roleplayer
2. i am a traumagenic system, so dont harass me please
3. i say "i" as a replacement for the "we" pronoun that other systems have, mostly because my host doesnt feel comfortable with that and i have high respect for them
4. if you know who the host of my system is, who i will call 'dm', dont shove it in their face, dont take advantage of them because they just so happen to have an alter of your favourite character, dont fakeclaim them, dont tell everyone that they have osdd-1b and has an scp alter, and most certainly, dont fucking obsess over them because of me, im not dealing with this type of shit AGAIN just because i exist

**dni**;
- anyone named anri, my deadname or my host's deadname*
- proshippers
- any kind of homophobic, transphobic, racist, neo-nazi, etc.
- adminbright defenders
  
###### *obviously, nobody knows what names i mean, but if i block or hide you and you dont know why, its probably because of this (only if your name starts with an f)

**iwc (interact with caution)**;
- hardcore clefdraki shippers*
- clef id kins or 'irls'*

###### *people who are OBSESSED with that ship
###### *this doesnt include other introjects + some of those types of people just make me uncomfortable, sorry
